# [Ocsature]

An [Eliom] framework to build your application easily.

Highly customisable and meant to include as few code as necessary.

Some parts are based on [Ocsigen Start].

The name comes from *Ocsigen + Ossature*. *Ossature* is
the french word for *backbone*. I cannot help but make bad puns. Sorry.
